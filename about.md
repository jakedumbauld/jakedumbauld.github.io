My background in healthcare opened my eyes to the world of possibilities of improving human health through data. While I had the knowledge of what the data points meant, I lacked the technical knowledge and skills to derive meaning from them. Since then, I've learned the tools of data wrangling, working with big data, and creating machine learning models in python. Now, I've applied these tools to the complex problem of phonocardiogram classification. I'm excited to share my work, and you can find it publicly available on my github.
